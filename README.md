# PassportAuthenticationWithSQL

I'm constantly coding new projects that need some sort of UserAuth. I mostly have experience using Passport for this but I'm always wrangling with 
setting up the boilerplate code so I've decided to just do a bit of boilerplate UserAuth using Passport on my
GitHub where I can just pull from this whenever starting a new project. Yay for efficiency!
